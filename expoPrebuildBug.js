This error typically occurs when using Expo's `expo prebuild` command, particularly when dealing with native modules or complex project setups. The root cause is often a mismatch between the environment where the prebuild happens and the environment Expo Go expects. This can involve differences in Node.js versions, dependencies, or system configurations.  The error message itself might be cryptic and lacks specifics.  For instance, you might see something like a generic build failure or an error related to a missing or incompatible native module.
