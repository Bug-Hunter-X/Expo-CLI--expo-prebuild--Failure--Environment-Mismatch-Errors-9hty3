# Expo CLI `expo prebuild` Failure: Environment Mismatch Errors

This repository demonstrates a common, yet difficult-to-diagnose, issue encountered when using the `expo prebuild` command within the Expo CLI. The core problem lies in inconsistencies between the environment where `expo prebuild` executes and the runtime environment of Expo Go.

## Problem

The `expo prebuild` command often fails with vague error messages, especially when dealing with native modules or complex projects. The error messages rarely pinpoint the root cause, making debugging challenging.

## Solution

This repository explores strategies for identifying and resolving these environment mismatches.  These include:

- **Verify Node.js version:** Ensure the Node.js version matches between your development environment and the environment where Expo Go runs.
- **Check dependencies:** Scrutinize package.json for any conflicting or missing dependencies.
- **Inspect native modules:** Investigate issues related to native modules, making sure they are correctly configured and compatible with both your development environment and Expo Go.
- **Clean and rebuild:**  Try a clean build process to eliminate potential cached issues.
- **Environment consistency:**  Strive for consistent environments across development and runtime to avoid these errors.  Consider using virtual environments (e.g., Docker) to enhance consistency.
