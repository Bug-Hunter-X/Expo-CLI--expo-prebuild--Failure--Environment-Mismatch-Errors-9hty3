The solution involves a multi-pronged approach focusing on environment consistency and dependency management:

1. **Verify Node.js version:** Use `node -v` in both your development environment and the environment used for `expo prebuild` to ensure they are identical.
2. **Check dependencies:**  Ensure all dependencies listed in your `package.json` are installed and compatible. Use `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure up-to-date versions.
3. **Clean the project:** Delete the `node_modules` folder and run `npm install` or `yarn install` again.
4. **Rebuild native modules:** If native modules are involved, try rebuilding them explicitly using the appropriate Expo commands or tools.
5. **Expo prebuild --clean:** This attempts to remove potentially corrupt cached files.
6. **Virtual Environments:** Consider using Docker or similar to create consistent build environments.

Example (Illustrative, the exact error and solution will depend on your project):

//expoPrebuildBug.js
//This file contains an error from a native module, simulated for illustrative purposes.
console.error('Simulated native module error during prebuild');

//expoPrebuildSolution.js
//This solution would involve fixing the actual native module issues, which is project-specific. 
console.log('After resolving the issue with native module. Retry `expo prebuild`');
